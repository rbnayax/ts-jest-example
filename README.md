# ts-jest-example

If using ts-jest (29) + ESM, tests are failing when using third party modules that expose typings 

## Setup
1. `yarn`

## Reproduce failed tests
1. `yarn test`

```bash
 FAIL  lib/fn/fn.spec.ts
  ‚óè Test suite failed to run

    lib/fn/fn.ts:1:21 - error TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'colorette'. '/home/regev/WebstormProjects/ts-jest-example/node_modules/colorette/index.cjs' implicitly has an 'any' type.
      Try `npm i --save-dev @types/colorette` if it exists or add a new declaration (.d.ts) file containing `declare module 'colorette';`

    1 import {green} from "colorette";

## Fix test by removing all references to `colorrete` in code
